                              which I did my Engineering in Computer Sciences from Pune University.</p>
                            <p>During my college years, I started a design venture with my college friends
                              and thus developed my interest in Graphic designing &amp; Web development

                            <p>After college, I was fortunate enough to bag the "sexiest job of the century"

                              I spent 8-10 months doing freelance analytics consultancy and web designing.</p>

								<p>I am a <b>multipotentialite</b> wired towards improving my skills in multiple subject areas. As a result, I am very <b>passionate</b> about what I do, I am a <b>rapid learner</b> and I can <b>easily adapt</b> to different streams of work.

								<p>I am also an <b>experiential learner</b></span> which means that if I learn something then I know it like muscle memory. However, at the same time, I also hate theoritical learning and its practically impossible for me to sit with a textbook for more than an hour in a stretch (unless otherwise engaging!)</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Exploring machine learning algorithms</li>
